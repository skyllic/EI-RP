    // Method 2: let the 'profilers' object get the instance for you
    profilers.exec("profiler2", expensiveFunction);

    // After executing the code, you can display the desired statistics in the SDK
    // using the following commands:

    //log(profiler1.mean) // Method 1
    //log(profilers.get("profiler2").mean) // Method 2

    // Note that the 'log' expression above will be printed every tick if executed
    // in the script itself, which might flood you SDK console. To avoid that, I
    // recommend to avoid logging in the script itself and use the command line in
    // the SDK app to display the statistics.
